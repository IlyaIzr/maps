Closest TODOs:
* get me back AND/OR top places navigation (we can run this if no features were return from the query)
** show prompt to go to the popular places page/route when no /placesByTiles returned
** popular places: sort by country, city (iso_3166_2). Fetch location names per language by it's iso. 
On place click - save place center location to DB and center to it.
* wide zoom range for features
* change map styles on dark theme
* don't change feature color on selection - use outline
* don't allow multiple rates from single account/ip? On a single day?

* check if `map.getSource(sourceId)?.setData({` keeps id that has iso in it for a feature on the map. After `map.queryRenderedFeatures(e.point);`
