Closest TODOs:

* reload after login/logout
* deleting feature bugs
* storing coords for cities isn't working properly - zoom is poor. Check coords maybe?
* feature data doesnt change on selected feature change
* change map styles on dark theme and review others
* don't allow multiple rates from single account/ip or device info? 
* mobile view - as we have 50% visits on mobile
