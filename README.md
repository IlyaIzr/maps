# Our Maps (i haven't come up a nice name so far)

## Before reading code
I've started this app in the mid 2021. I'm fixing some issues in 2023, so part of this app is really old and done by a less experienced guy. I've added vite and typescript support for client.

## About app
This app collects user impressions of the places and draws map of those places according to overall ratings.
Thus you can quickly see what areas are cool, average or awful. I believe this is valuable information that can be used in many areas, starting from scheduling a walking route and finising with urban value analysis

## How to run

I've used pnpm, and then you've got to run `dev` scripts in root folder to run server and in a `/client` folder to run React front end
